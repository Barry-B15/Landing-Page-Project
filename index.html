                <p>
                    Blowfish is very popular in Japan. It is among the most expensive dishes at sushi places. I feel it is necessary for us to know a few facts about this fish.

                        Pufferfish can inflate into a ball shape to evade predators. Also known as blowfish, these clumsy swimmers fill their elastic stomachs with huge amounts of water (and sometimes air) and blow themselves up to several times their normal size.

                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Some pufferfish species also have spines on their skin to ward off predators. Even if a predator gobbles up a puffer before it inflates, it won't enjoy the snack. Most pufferfish contain a toxic substance that makes them foul tasting and potentially deadly
                        to other fish. The toxin is deadly to humans. There is enough poison in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.</blockquote>

                        Now we can understand why it costs so much; it takes years of training for the chef
                        to get the skills to completely remove the poison and
                        to get a license to prepare this special creature for diners.

                        Remora are nicknamed sharksucker or suckerfish as they use their
                        suckers to suck on to larger fish for most of their journeys.</p>

                                THE REMORA IS so ridiculous that no one would try to make it up. The top of its head is
                                a giant, flat suction
                                cup. It uses
                                the cup to lock onto the bodies of bigger animals, such as
                                sharks, sea turtles, and whales. As the big animal swims for
                                miles in search of a meal, the remora hangs on for the ride.
                                When its host finds a victim, the remora detaches and feasts
                                on the remains. It sometimes cleans its hostâ€™s body and mouth
                                of parasites, and then clamps its head back on for another
                                ride.

                        instead they have rings that go all the way down into their tail.
                        Sea horses have 3 main fins to help them swim and steer.
                        They are one fin on their back and one small fin on each side of their head.
                        Seahorse also have a 4th fin under their belly for stability control.
                        Their fins help them stabilize their body in the water.
                        The seahorse male is also known to carry the babies.</p>

                            Seahorses are tiny fish that are named for the shape of their head, which looks like the
                            head of ... yup, you guessed it -a tiny horse. There are around 36 seahorse species, which
                            are
                            found in tropical and temperate coastal waters where they swim upright among seaweed and
                            other
                            plants.

                        <blockquote>
                            Seahorses' bodies are covered in tiny, spiny plates, all the way
                            from their head down to their curled, flexible tail. The tail can grasp objects,
                            which comes in handy when these cool critters want to anchor themselves to vegetation.
                            To move forward through the water, seahorses use their dorsal fin (back fin).
                            To move up and down, they adjust the volume of air in a tiny pocket inside their body,
                            called a 'swim bladder'.
