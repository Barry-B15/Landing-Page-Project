# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)

## What I have done
As a first step, I have:
* Connected the index.html to the js file
* Added a few js code to generate the head navigation and 
* Added some CSS style to the links.
### Next:
* I added a smooth scrolling effect
* With some CSS update
### Adding Data to the Sections
I've added data from the .js file but lost the initial rolling circles
What am I doing wrong?
### Activate the section near the top of viewport
* Fixed the rolling circles in the sections
* Now the sections change when scroll to the top of the viewport 
* The active sections also change colors
* A new section was also added making four sections in total
#### Images added
Just a minor update, added images to the sections
#### Bigger Screen
Made some tweaks to allow the page respond better on bigger screens
