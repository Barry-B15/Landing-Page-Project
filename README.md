## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

# What I did on this branch.
This is just an update on what I have been doing. 
Here I addded data dynamically using the the js/app.js file and a few CSS styling to it.
One observation is that I lost the rolling circle that was in the start project.
Would need a fix.
