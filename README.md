# Title: Landing Page Project

## Prerequisites:
 * A computer
 * A personal or company dormain, or webhost
## Installing:
Simply upload to a host site or personal dormain following your webhost instructions and this is ready for use.

## Description:
This is a dynamic landing page made with: 
* HTML as the framework, 
* CSS for styling the sections. Psuedo-classes are used to show some rolling circles when a section becomes active.
* AND JavaScript to dymaically build the navigation.
The smooth scrolling effect and the scroll effects are also done with Javascript.
When a user scrolls down, the sections on the navigation also changes to show the active section

## USE Cases:
This a single web page, good for marketing of any product of choice. It is the page the user lands on after clicking on a web search, we can also use it as a destination page of a regular website. 
I have used this landing page here to give information about some deep sea creatures. 
These can be replaced with whatever product the user may want to highlight or to increase conversion rate for a marketing campaign.

## How To Use
Add or remove sections to the HTML and the JavaScript will automatically add the navigator and it becomes accessible by clicks or scroll.

## Acknowledgement:
Thanks to Udacity for providing the initial static HTML framework and CSS psuedo-classes  that helped to build this landing page.

## Some of What I have done
As a first step, I have:
* Connected the index.html to the js file
* Added a few js code to generate the head navigation and 
* Added some CSS style to the links.
### Next:
* I added a smooth scrolling effect
* With some CSS update
### Adding Data to the Sections
I've added data from the .js file but lost the initial rolling circles
What am I doing wrong?
### Activate the section near the top of viewport
* Fixed the rolling circles in the sections
* Now the sections change when scroll to the top of the viewport 
* The active sections also change colors
* A new section was also added making four sections in total
#### Images added
Just a minor update, added images to the sections
#### Bigger Screen
Made some tweaks to allow the page respond better on bigger screens
## Last update
I have made the nav menu to show what section the user scrolls to
