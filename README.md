# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)

## What I have done
As a first step, I have:
* Connected the index.html to the js file
* Added a few js code to generate the head navigation and 
* Added some CSS style to the links.
Next:
* I added a smooth scrolling effect
* With some CSS update

## Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
